# What is Html 
- Imagine building a house. HTML is like the blueprint that shows where the walls, doors, and windows go. It's a language that uses special "tags" to organize the different parts of a web page, like headings, paragraphs, and images. These tags tell your web browser how to display everything so it looks right.

- HTML also lets you create links, like the ones you click to jump between different websites. That's the "hypertext" part! It's what makes the web feel connected, allowing you to explore different pages and information with just a click.  
```javascript
<h1> This is a heading </h1>
<p> This is a paragraph of text. </p>
<a href="https://www.google.com"> This is a link to Google </a>
```
