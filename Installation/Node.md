## Introduction
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side, enabling you to build scalable and high-performance applications.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Administrative privileges to install software.

## Installing Node.js
1. Go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Download the Windows Installer (.msi).
   - **macOS**: Download the macOS Installer (.pkg).
   - **Linux**: Follow the instructions for your distribution (e.g., using a package manager).

3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation. You can choose the default settings for most options.

## Verifying the Installation
After installation, you can verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) were installed successfully:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
